This repository contains the slides for the presentation [[https://connect.centos.org/#selfabolition]["The self-abolition of

** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./end-of-enterprise-linux.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing ~(require
'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then export the
org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs end-of-enterprise-linux.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
